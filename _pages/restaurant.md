<p style="text-align: center;">In 2014 we achieved 3AA rosettes, rewarding our team for their dedication to producing inspiring and innovative dishes, using superb quality local produce.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our menus are designed to complement the characterand attributes of the hotel, and to portray our passion for fine dining. Dan Shotton and his team produce menus excelling in design, flavour and innovation, served in a relaxed, romantic atmosphere, where you are looked after by knowledgeable, friendly and professional staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our evening menu boasts an abundance of exciting flavours with surprises throughout, including canapés, amuse bouche, pre dessert, tea or coffee and truffles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Join us for our “Sparkling” afternoon tea or “Light Bites”, and you can relax in our beautiful Master’s Room, Bar or gardens, and indulge yourself in the food and our stunning location.</p>
