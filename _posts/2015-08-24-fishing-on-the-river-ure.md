At Yorebridge House we can offer 15 miles of double banked fishing on the River Ure around the Hawes and Bainbridge area, through the High Hawes and Abbotside Angling Association. This is truly wonderful fishing for the disconcerting angler, offering true upland fly fishing which is noted for its Brown Trout and Grayling. These waters lend themselves to be fished through methods such as; traditional Yorkshire spiders, nymphs and dry flies, which bring fruitful, catch returns due to the good hatches all year round. 

Here at Yorebridge House we are a very fisherman friendly place making it the perfect location for any angler to situate themselves while fishing in the Yorkshire Dales. We have teamed up with Mount St John Sporting, therefore, through renowned casting instructor and guide Olly Shepherd, we can offer guided days and tuition on the River Ure for ANY ability of angler. We can also cater for any fishing groups wishing to visit this charming part Yorkshire. The price will include all your tackle, equipment, EA rod licence and transport to and from the hotel.  If you have any questions to do with the fly fishing here at Yorbridge House we will be only too happy to help.
If you wish to fish the river without a guide or instructor we can arrange the fishing for you, but you must own a current Environment Agency rod licence. Day tickets for the river are Â£16 per day.
