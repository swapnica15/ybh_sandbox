Stage 1 Cycles are a family run cycling hub located in Askrigg, 1 mile from Yorebridge House. They can offer affordable hire, repairs as well as supported bike tours around the National Parks. Their guided cycle tours start from our shop in Askrigg and are a great way for anyone to explore the Dales. Whether you are an elite cyclist or a new starter they have the services to support you.

In addition to regular off-road and road bikes they have trailers, tag along and junior bikes for hire, ensuring there is a way for everyone to participate. 

They can also offer a bespoke guided tour programme which will build a cycling experience around your individual requirements. Whether you would like a leisurely cycle to Semer Water with the kids for a picnic or 3 days off road in the hills and a crash pad, we can accommodate all your requirements and get you on the road.
