The bespoke tour especially designed for our guests includes being whisked around the dales in luxury and comfort by a chauffeur driven Range Rover, the driver being the utmost host with a wealth of knowledge and information about the Dales and surrounding areas. The tour will take you through the stunning Wensleydale and Swaledale scenery, market towns, picturesque villages, castles and waterfalls.

The tour will start from the hotel, where you will be taken down the valley to Aysgarth Falls, over the tops to Middleham, passed the famous gallops and Castle and onto the Thorpe Perrow Arboretum for morning coffee and a wander through the open gardens, with the possibility to take in a falconry display in the depths of the arboretum. You will then go onto the Norman fortress that is Richmond with its Castle and shops for a quick bite to eat. The journey will then take you into Swaledale and the picturesque village of Reeth, over the tops of the Dale, part of the Tour de France 2014 route, passed the famous Buttertubs and down into the Market town of Hawes. 

A quick stop at the Wensleydale Creamery to top up on the famous local cheese, finished with Afternoon Tea back at the hotel to finish your day in the relaxing atmosphere that is Yorebridge House.
