There is an abundance of great produce all around us in North Yorkshire and we are proud to champion them, following the easing of the lockdown we have worked tirelessly with our local suppliers to ensure maximum compliance with COVID-secure policies and procedures.
In 2017 we launced our kitchen garden which now supplies vegetables and fresh fruit for your menu as well as cresses and herbs to garnish your cocktails. The garden is tended to by our team of chefs and has provided a welcome respite from the lockdown over the last 14 weeks!
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hammonds Butchers (Bainbridge)</strong>
Situated a couple of minutes from Yorebridge House, this family run butchers has supplied
Meat to us since the first day we opened in 2008.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wellocks Fruit And Veg (Lomeshaye)</strong>
