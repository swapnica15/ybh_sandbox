About 1.86 miles (3.00km)

A three kilometre low level walk through Freeholders and St Joseph’s Woods taking in the Lower and Middle Falls. The walk starts and finishes at the Aysgarth Falls National Park Centre car park.

From the entrance of the car park the route passes under the railway bridge, past the entrance to the former Aysgarth railway station and on into Freeholders Wood. An area of semi natural woodland owned and managed as a coppice with standards by the National Park Authority with the help of volunteers. The woodland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is home to a wide range of plants animals. Once through the wood the route crosses open pastureland and then returns under the railway bridge to St Joseph’s Wood, a new native 15-hectare broadleaf woodland planted in 1998. The route returns through the centre of Freeholders Wood to the start of the Millennium Trail. A surfaced trail leading to the Lower and Middle Falls viewing platforms through the woodland and along Riddings Field, passing four interpretative art works. Upon reaching the Lower Falls, the route then returns to the National Park Centre via the Millennium Trail.

Interpretation and leaflets are available within the National Park Centre explain the important features of the woodland, river and falls.

To visit the Upper Falls, follow the path around the edge of the car park and follow the path down to the entrance. Please note that the Upper Falls is private land and an admission charge is made by way of an honesty box for providing access.
