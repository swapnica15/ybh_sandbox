To celebrate Afternoon Tea Week 12th-18th August and with the promise of a long, sunny English Summer, we have teamed up with our friends at Rathfinny Estate to create our English Sparkling Afternoon Tea!

Rathfinny, in East Sussex, occupies a perfect south-facing slope, just three miles from the sea, and its climate, chalk soils and aspect make it probably the most perfect place to produce wine in a region that is already producing some of the best, award winning English sparkling wines.

We think a glass of the Blanc de Noir or Rose pairs beautifully with our full afternoon tea selection; Free Range Egg &amp; Cress, Smoked Salmon &amp; Cucumber, Yorkshire Ham &amp; Mustard, Wensleydale Cheese &amp; Chutney Sandwiches, A Selection of Homemade Cakes and Pastries, Scones with Clotted Cream &amp; Jam, Yorkshire Tea, Coffee, Herbal Teas.

To book your English Sparkling Afternoon Tea please call our friendly team on 01969 652060 or email us on <a href="mailto:enquiries@yorebridgehouse.co.uk">enquiries@yorebridgehouse.co.uk</a>
