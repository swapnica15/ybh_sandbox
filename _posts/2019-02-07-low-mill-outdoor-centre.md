"Real adventure in the Real outdoors" long established local outdoor education provider in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales.

Explore the hidden dales, in gorges and caves, paddling your canoe across Semerwater, abseiling off a disused railway viaduct or more sedately on a local walk, maybe some archery might hit the spot.

Full day or 1/2 day sessions for groups or individuals can be arranged, also tailored to meet your corporate day. All sessions include using our own equipment and fully qualified professional instructors.
