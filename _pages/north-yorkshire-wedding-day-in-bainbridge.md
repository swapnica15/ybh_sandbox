Bainbridge is located where England's shortest river, the Bain, meets the River Ure. The village is one of the longest established settlements in the Yorkshire Dales. There is a single watering hole in the Bainbridge, which is said to be the oldest in Yorkshire with a history going back to 1445. There are also several tearooms and a village shop. Most intriguing of all, Bainbridge has Roman roads and even the remains of a fort. With such a rich history, there are plenty of places to wander, cycle and explore.

Our team at Yorebridge House are eager to share our passion for luxury and great taste. From the moment you arrive, we’ll welcome you and your guests, looking after your every need. To top it off, our chef will offer you a wide range of dining options from our 3AA Rosette menu.
