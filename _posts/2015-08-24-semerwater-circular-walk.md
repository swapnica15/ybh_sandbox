<strong>About 3.74 miles (6.00km)</strong>

A 6km circular walk around Semerwater, with an option of a fell top return route. This optional loop makes a 7.5km total walk.

Leave your car on the foreshore parking area and set off on the road in a southerly direction. Opposite Low Blean farm, take the footpath due south, towards Stalling Busk. Please keep in single file across the meadowland. The footpath passes through Semerwater Nature Reserve, managed by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Semerwater is not only important for birds, but plankton, mayflies and crayfish. The path continues onto the ruins of the old chapel of Stalling Busk. This was built in 1772, please take care if you look around the graveyard area. Head towards Marsett, using the footbridges to cross over Cragdale Water and Raydale Beck. Once in Marsett, there are two choices of return. The shortest route is back along Marsett Lane, cutting the corner off, using a footpath 400m before Countersett. It’s a short walk over Semerwater Bridge back to the foreshore. If the weather’s fine (it is sometimes!) it’s worth the effort required getting up onto the fell top above Marsett. Follow the path towards Knights Close, but turn off to the right after 300m. This path leads up through the Cow Pasture, linking with the bridleway on the tops. Follow the bridleway east eventually joining Crag Side Road. Look for buzzards around here! Drop down the road, skirting past Countersett and over Semerwater Bridge (first built by the Quakers) and back to the parking area.
